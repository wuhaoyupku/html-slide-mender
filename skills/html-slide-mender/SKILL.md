description: Visual editor for local or saved HTML files, especially HTML PPTs, AI-generated presentation pages, one-page web slide decks, and dynamic JavaScript slide pages. Use this skill whenever the user wants HTML 编辑, HTML编辑, PPT 编辑, PPT编辑, HTML PPT 编辑, 网页编辑, 演示稿编辑, 幻灯片编辑, or wants to make a local HTML editable, edit or modify an HTML PPT, fix text, add text/images, replace images, adjust layout/position/size, move/scale/resize/stretch a title/image/card/block, or says phrases like “修改这个 HTML”, “HTML PPT 可编辑”, “标题往上一点”, “调整版面”, or “改宽高”. Clean export patches text/images/backgrounds/layout styles back into the original source HTML instead of saving runtime DOM. Do not use for live websites, authenticated online pages, generic source-code edits, or PPTX/PowerPoint files; ask for a saved local HTML copy first.

# HTML Mender

Use this skill to turn a local `.html` deck into a browser-editable copy. HTML Mender is built for HTML PPTs and AI-generated slide pages where the user wants small visual edits instead of regenerating the whole page.

## Core Behavior

- Generates an editable `*.editable.html` next to the source unless `--out` is provided.
- Keeps the original source HTML as the clean-export baseline.
- Exports by patching changed or newly inserted text/images, background images, and layout styles back into the source.
- Avoids saving editor UI, generated runtime state, navigation dots, current-slide transforms, or injected scripts.
- Never modifies the original HTML by default.

## Workflow

1. Locate the user's local source HTML. If multiple files match, ask which one to edit.
2. Run the injector:

```bash
node /path/to/this-skill/scripts/inject-html-editor.mjs /absolute/path/input.html
```

3. Open the generated editable file directly, preferably as `file:///absolute/path/name.editable.html`.
4. Let the user edit visually in the browser.
5. Tell the user to click `下载 HTML` / `Download HTML` to save the durable clean result.

Do not start a local HTTP server just to view the file unless `file://` blocks required local assets.

## Script Options

```bash
node scripts/inject-html-editor.mjs <input.html> \
  --out <output.html> \
  --lang zh-CN \
  --mode basic
```

- `--out`: custom output path.
- `--lang zh-CN|en`: editor language. Default: `zh-CN`.
- `--mode basic`: keeps external links and applies edits back to source HTML. Default: `basic`.
- `--no-autostart`: inject runtime without starting the editor automatically.

## Important Notes

- Local draft saving is disabled; refreshing can lose unsaved edits.
- Keep editable/exported HTML next to the original assets when the deck uses relative CSS or images.
- CSP meta tags are preserved. If CSP blocks inline startup, use the browser extension workflow or ask the user how to handle the trusted file.
- The skill runtime does not bundle remote CSS/images and avoids network-backed export.
- If the editable page appears unstyled, regenerate it beside the original HTML so relative paths resolve.

## Version Notes

### 0.1.14

- Improves Chinese search and trigger wording for `HTML 编辑`, `PPT 编辑`, `HTML PPT 编辑`, `网页编辑`, `演示稿编辑`, and `幻灯片编辑`.
- Keeps the skill scope explicitly limited to local or saved HTML files and excludes live websites, authenticated online pages, generic source-code edits, and PPTX files.

### 0.1.13

- Adds direct border handles in the default text/image editing mode.
- Drag the selected border or label to move an element.
- Drag side handles to resize width/height; drag corner handles to resize proportionally.
- Default image dragging moves the image frame; hold Option/Alt to adjust image content inside the frame.
- Shift / Cmd / Ctrl multi-select works in default text/image mode and opens alignment / same-size controls.
- Overlapping text/image boxes are ordered so individual elements are easier to select.
- Removes the top-level Text/Image vs. Move layout switch because border handles now cover the normal layout workflow.
- Shortens the toolbar status text to fit in compact toolbars.
- Fixes Ctrl/Cmd+Z when focus is on editor UI such as image handles or popover controls.
- Fixes first-drag undo for images whose frame originally had no inline style, and covers sequential image drags so they do not snap back.
- Adds a movable cursor when hovering a selected text box's draggable border or label.

### 0.1.12

- Adds `新增文字` / `Add text` and `新增图片` / `Add image` toolbar actions.
- Persists inserted text and image elements through source-based `basic` export.

### 0.1.11

- Renames the public ClawHub listing, skill title, and visible description to HTML Mender.

### 0.1.10

- Adds temporary multi-selection in layout mode with `Shift` / `Cmd` / `Ctrl` click.
- Multi-selected modules can move, scale, resize, reset, align, and match width/height together.
- Batch layout operations undo and redo as one history step.

### 0.1.9

- Fixes injection for complex HTML files that contain embedded `</body>` strings inside JavaScript data.
- Keeps unchanged source HTML byte-for-byte during clean export.
- Exports only elements that the editor actually modified, then applies source-string patches before falling back to DOM serialization.

### 0.1.8

- Adds `移动缩放 / 改宽高 / 恢复` in layout mode.
- `移动缩放` uses `transform: scale(...)` for safer visual scaling.
- `改宽高` writes real `width` / `height` for width-only, height-only, or stretched changes.
- `恢复` clears movement, scale, and editor-added size while preserving original transform and inline dimensions.

### 0.1.7

- Adds `文字/图片` and `位置微调` mode switching.
- Adds drag and arrow-key layout movement for visible text, images, cards, and blocks.
- Preserves layout changes in clean source-based export.
- Improves nested layout selection so smaller inner elements remain selectable.
- Adds explicit edit-box state feedback.

## Example

User: `帮我把 /Users/me/deck.html 变成可编辑版本`

Run:

```bash
node /path/to/this-skill/scripts/inject-html-editor.mjs /Users/me/deck.html --lang zh-CN --mode basic
```

Then open `/Users/me/deck.editable.html` for visual editing.
